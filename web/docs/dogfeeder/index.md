title: Dog Feeder
---

## Problem

It is easy to overlook whether the dog has been fed when there are mutliple members in your 
household. It happens almost daily when the question gets asked "Did you feed the dog?" or 
you have to tell others in the household "Do not feed the dog again as I have already 
fed him". 

## Solution 

I wanted to get rid of this problem and sometimes confusion, so I build an automated 
dog feeder. The food would be dispensed at the times specified and there would not be any 
confusion about whether the dog has been fed or not.
